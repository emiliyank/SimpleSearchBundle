Bundle usage
------------
This is a bundle made mostly with learning purpose. Not recommended to use in real apps!

This Bundle provides Simple Search for Content in Files. It is implemented for Symfony 2.8.
It works the following way - there is a form with 3 fields:
1) Search Content:* - the content that you are looking for
2) File Type: - the file type. If you want to restrict the search 
for specific file type. Must not put dot (.) for the file type.
3) Search Path: - path you want to make the search. Starts from the path of the project and has for options all path in depth 2 dirs inside the starting path.
